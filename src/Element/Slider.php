/**
 * Class Slider
 *
 * In web design terminology, the term Slider is used for a slide show added into a web page.
 * Sliders can be used on all kind of websites however theyâ€™re most commonly used on business websites or professional
 * portfolio websites. One clear advantage of using a slider is that website owners can place all their important
 * content in a visually appealing and interactive slide show at the top of the page before their main content. This
 * allows users to quickly see the highlights and take action.
 *
 * Sliders can run slide shows automatically without user input by moving slides on pre-defined time interval. Sliders
 * can also respond to user interaction like click or swipe to view next or previous slides. Additionally, sliders can
 * also have buttons or thumbnails which users can click to view a particular slide in the slider.
